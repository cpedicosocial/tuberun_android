TubeRun is a London transport app that aims to present the most important data that TfL offers in a single app. My motivation for writing it was the low quality of similar apps found in the market. Typically they offer only a single important feature (eg a journey planner, a good map, bus departures) but they omit the others forcing you to install multiple apps which seldom work in a straightforward manner. In TubeRun, expect to find everything that matters so that you won't have to have 4 different similar apps installed. Features include:

-A Journey Planner that uses the TfL API for up-to-date travel plans
-Live Bus, Underground and DLR Departures
-Nearby Tube lines, Bus routes and Cycle Hire stations (with live bike/dock availability data)
-Oyster Balance
-Underground Refund Claims
-The real Tube Map
-Favorites
-Current and Weekend Status Updates
-Fast ICS-inspired interface that doesn't rediscover the wheel
